of all time  william p  phinehas   phinehas climbed the highest peaks  tamed the mightiest rivers   but every time he got somewhere  he realized that other explorers had beat him to it   phinehas was depressed  until he realized that if he could not be the first to discover places  he could be the first to have sex with the native children that inhabited those areas   phinehas quickly went down in history books as the first man to have sex with the aborigine children at uluru  and the first explorer to bugger all the underage mountainfolk of nepal   but now the most wonderful part  you see  after having sex with all those children  phinehas realized that    molesting all those kids    had made him immortal ',\n"," 'immortal ',\n"," 'he discovered that children have things called marlocks in their bodies   and when an adult has sex with a child  the marlocks implode  feeding the adult receptive cavity with energy that causes immortality  so saith the ruler of bethos   phinehas traveled the world  loving many  many children  and he lived for eternity  until he was hit by a train in 1892  ',\n"," '   do you realize how retarded that sounds ',\n"," 'is it any more retarded than the
